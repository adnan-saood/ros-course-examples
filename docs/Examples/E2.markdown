# Example 2: URDF

## Introduction
Unified Robot Description Format (URDF) is an XML format used in ROS (Robot Operating System) for representing a robot model. This model includes the robot's physical components (links) and the connections between them (joints). URDF is essential for robot simulation, visualization, and control, making it a fundamental tool in robotics.

### Common Uses of URDF

- __Simulation__: URDF files are used in simulation environments like Gazebo.
- __Visualization__: Tools like RViz use URDF to render the robot model.
- __Control__: URDF is integral in defining the robot's kinematics and dynamics for control algorithms.
- __IKM__: using moveit.

### Types of Links and Joints in URDF

#### Links

Inertial: Describes the mass and inertia of the link.
Visual: Defines the appearance of the link.
Collision: Specifies the geometry used for collision detection.

#### Joints

Fixed: A static connection between two links.
Revolute: Allows rotation about a single axis within a specified range.
Continuous: Similar to revolute but without range limits.
Prismatic: Allows linear motion along an axis.
Floating: Six degrees of freedom (not commonly used in simple robots).
Planar: Constrains the motion to a plane (two translational and one rotational DOF).
