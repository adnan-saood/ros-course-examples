# Tutorial 2: Homework and Project Submission Guideline

## Homeworks

### First submission
1. Issue this script in an empty folder

    ```bash
    BASE_DIR='homework_'$USER

    mkdir $BASE_DIR
    cd $BASE_DIR
    mkdir src
    cd src

    # Initialize the workspace
    catkin_init_workspace

    catkin_create_pkg homework_1 std_msgs rospy

    cd ..
    catkin_make
    ```

2. Add a `README.MD` file to your workspace folder, and fill it with the following:

    1. Name and email
    2. Description of your implementation (repeat this for each homework)
    3. Folder structure of your package (repeat this for each homework)

    > You can check how to properly write in the markdown format [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)


3. Create an empty public github or gitlab repository. You can either use your public github account, or using ENSTA's server [gitlab.ensta.fr](gitlab.ensta.fr)

4. Push your workspace to the repository and send a link to the submission link.

### Later submissions

You can add packages to your submission repository by the command `catkin_create_pkg homework_1 std_msgs rospy`. Attention!, make sure you include the dependencies you need each time you create a package in the CLI command and make sure to verify they exist in the `package.xml` and `CMakeLists.txt` files. If you are going to create c++ packages you need to specify `roscpp` instead of `rospy`.

The naming convention for the packages is homework_[Number]. If you want to create multiple packages per a submission then you are required to do the following:

1. Create a folder in the `src` with the name `homework_[Number]`. 
2. cd inside this folder `cd homework_[Number]`
3. create your packages with anyname you want by using the command `catkin_create_pkg` multiple times. 

In this manner you have created a `meta-package` named `homework_[Number]`, with several daughter packages names arbitrary. 

## Project

You are required to submit stricty a public git repository to the submission link, along with required material discussed in the course (report, ppt, ...)
