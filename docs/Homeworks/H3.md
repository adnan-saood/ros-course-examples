# Homework 3: Grand Integrators

For the past months, the tower cranes never stopped in preparations of the metro line 18 passing through the plateau. If we are to model this crane using the URDF syntax, we would be able to visualize its structure and interact with it.

## Objective 1

Create a new ROS workspace and populate it with the necessary files to model a building crane. The crane is supposed to have 3 degrees of freedom. Refer to images online to understand how it moves.

The crane is supposed to be able to transport goods in an area of 25x25 meters squared, with heights up to 40 meters. Calculate joint values that would allow for such a purpose.

## Objective 2

Rewrite your URDF file as a XACRO file. You are free to organize it to your liking.

The XACRO needs to be modular so that it accepts the building space dimensions as parameters. 

## Submission Guideline

Refer to the tutorial 2: submission guideline.
